# CSI-Project-Report
Progress of the CSI Project.

## Week 1
- Completion of the assignments of freeCodeCamp on NodeJS and MongoDB

## Week 2
- Started with exercises of JS on freeCodeCamp.
- Created github repository for the project.
- Cloned the theme template
- Edited the template
- Read articles on handlebars and express

After these two weeks, I started working on the main repository for the projects Cybros-Web-Application (https://github.com/OpenSouce-LNMIIT/Cybros-Web-Application). I started with solving Issue #114, that was adding the feature of Password Hashing which was missing earlier.

To solve this issue, I added the package 'password-hash'. It is a NodeJS library to simplify use of hashed passwords.

Next, I started adding the new UI template to the project beginning with the header and footer.
